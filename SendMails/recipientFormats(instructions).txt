#READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY AND KEEP THIS FILE FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE#

1-> Create a recipientFormats.txt file
2-> Write/paste one recipient format on each line

TIPS:
There are two arguments you can set for your emails here
i.e., prefix and suffix for the recipients emails
The format is,

prefix:(Recipient Name e.g., xyz or xyz.com):suffix

here, the two colon (:) represents seperating the prefix, recipient name and the suffix and 
the colons should be present in each line

You can define as many formats as you want, just follow these key points,
anything before the first colon will be taken as prefix
and
anything after the second colon will be taken as suffix

Note: No need to write anything between the colon as it is ignored and recipient names will be obtained from
recipients.txt file and this file is only for defining the formats where the email will be sent.

If sending mails to individuals, (say xyz at xyz@gmail.com and xyz@yahoo.com) then write as,
For example:
::@gmail.com
::@yahoo.com

If sending mails to websites, (say xyz.com at support@xyz.com and care@xyz.com) then write as,
For example:
support@::
support@::

If you dont want to use any recipient format then just write :: on the first line,
For example:
::
