Hey Cyber Geek

I am (your name here) from (where you are from) and I want to thank you for creating this script 
to automate the emailing process which is a boring and repetitive process. This takes a while to setup 
but its worth it as  mass mails can be sent with this without ending up in spam mail.
Thanks for being awesome!

Regards
